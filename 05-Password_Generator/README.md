In this project i have build the simple Password generator that generates password uniquely all the time. User can set the lenght of the password , can select wheather password should contain number and character or not. It makes users to create strong passwords every time .

In this project i have used the hooks to maintain the states of password below is the summary of react hooks in concise way.

**React Hooks** are functions that let function components use state, lifecycle behavior, and other React features without classes. Hooks must be called only at the top level of components or custom hooks. `useState` is used to store and update state and causes re-render on change, `useEffect` is used for side effects like API calls or subscriptions and runs based on its dependency array, `useRef` provides a mutable reference that does not trigger re-renders and is commonly used for DOM access, and `useContext` allows sharing data globally without prop drilling. `useMemo` is used to optimize performance by memoizing the **result of expensive calculations** and recomputes only when dependencies change, while `useCallback` memoizes **function references** to prevent unnecessary re-creation of functions and unwanted re-renders, especially when functions are passed to child components or used in `useEffect`. Hooks should be used intentionally as optimization tools, not by default, and custom hooks can be created to reuse logic across components.
